# Claude Code Docker

English | [‰∏≠Êñá](README.md)

## üöÄ Quick Start - One Command

```bash
docker run --rm -it -e ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://api.moonshot.cn/anthropic" -w /root --name my-claude-code dust96747/claude-code bash
```

Then run `claude` command inside the container to start Claude Code.

> üí° **Tip**: The container starts with a bash terminal. Run the `claude` command to launch Claude Code, and the system will prompt you to enter your API Key. Please have your Moonshot API Key ready beforehand.

## Introduction

Claude Code Docker is a pre-packaged Docker image featuring Anthropic's official Claude Code CLI tool. It provides developers with a ready-to-use AI programming assistant environment, enabling quick Claude Code experience without local Node.js and dependency installation.

üîó **Project Repository**: [https://github.com/dust96747/claude-code](https://github.com/dust96747/claude-code)

**üî• Special Note: This project is pre-configured to use Moonshot's [Kimi K2 trillion-parameter model](https://platform.moonshot.cn/console/api-keys), which provides a fully compatible Anthropic API interface optimized for users in mainland China, ensuring stable and fast Claude Code experience! It also supports [SiliconFlow](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/tSgpfq1D) platform, offering more model choices and cost-effective GenAI cloud services.**

## Quick Start

### Method 1: Docker Hub Image Deployment (Recommended)

Direct image retrieval and execution from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dust96747/claude-code):

```bash
docker run --rm -it -e ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://api.moonshot.cn/anthropic" -w /root --name my-claude-code dust96747/claude-code bash
```

Then run `claude` command inside the container to start Claude Code.

### Method 2: Local Build Deployment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dust96747/claude-code.git
cd claude-code

# Build the image
docker build -t claude-code .

# Run the container
docker run --rm -it \
  -e ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://api.moonshot.cn/anthropic" \
  -w /root \
  --name my-claude-code \
  claude-code bash

# Then run claude command inside the container
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL | Base URL for Claude API | https://api.moonshot.cn/anthropic |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Claude API key (prompted at runtime) | - |
| ANTHROPIC_MODEL | Model name to use | - |

## Usage

### Basic Operation Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**: After container startup, follow prompts to enter your API key for authentication
2. **Start Conversation**: Directly ask programming questions or describe your needs, and Claude will provide intelligent suggestions
3. **Project Initialization**: In your project directory, type `/init` to let Claude understand your project structure
4. **Safe Exit**: Use `Ctrl+C` or type `exit` command to quit the conversation

### Project File Access Configuration

Allow Claude Code to directly access and edit your local projects:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -e ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://api.moonshot.cn/anthropic" \
  -v /path/to/your/project:/workspace \
  -w /workspace \
  --name my-claude-code \
  dust96747/claude-code bash
```

Then run `claude` command inside the container.

### Multi-Platform API Service Support

#### Anthropic Official API (International Users)
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -w /root \
  --name my-claude-code \
  dust96747/claude-code bash
```

#### Moonshot Kimi K2 Service (Recommended/China Users)
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -e ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://api.moonshot.cn/anthropic" \
  -w /root --name my-claude-code \
  dust96747/claude-code bash
```

#### SiliconFlow Service (Cost-Effective Recommended)
[SiliconFlow](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/tSgpfq1D) is a cost-effective GenAI cloud service platform based on excellent open-source models, supporting text conversation, image generation, video generation, voice synthesis and other AI functions.

> All services require running the `claude` command inside the container after startup

## Advanced Configuration

### Configuration Data Persistence

Save API keys and personal configurations to avoid repeated input:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -e ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://api.moonshot.cn/anthropic" \
  -v ~/.config/claude:/root/.config/claude \
  -w /root \
  --name my-claude-code \
  dust96747/claude-code bash
```

Then run `claude` command inside the container.

### Method 3: Docker Compose Deployment (Multi-Service Support)

```bash
# Start background services
docker compose up -d

# Enter Moonshot Kimi K2 service
docker exec -u root -it claude-code-kimi-1 bash 

# Or choose to enter SiliconFlow service
docker exec -u root -it claude-code-flow-1 bash 

# Navigate to working directory
cd your_project

# Start Claude Code
claude

# When prompted "Do you want to use this API key?" select Yes
# Confirm that the API Key and API Base URL are correctly configured
# Type /init to initialize the project and start AI-assisted development
```
